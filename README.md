The folder contains all the code required for my component of the project. The code can be compiled and tested through Android Studio. 

I have utilized a dummy UI to test my components multi-threading and API call capabiltiies. The logs print all relevant outputs. Please look through that as well. 

If you would like to test the rest call, please host a dummy server through Node Express or something similar, and append the URL in the code. Please ensure the return response structure matches the one in the code.
